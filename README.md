# 🏫 Student Bazaar

A full-stack web platform developed as part of the MCA program at **GLA University** (2nd Year, 4th Semester – 2025).

This project was designed and implemented by a 5-member team, led by **Aman Yadav** (Lead Developer).

---

## 🎯 Abstract

**Student Bazaar** is an interactive online marketplace tailored for university students to **buy, sell, or exchange used goods and services** within their campus ecosystem.  
The platform bridges the gap between students seeking affordable resources and those wishing to resell pre-owned academic items—books, electronics, accessories, etc.—in a safe, student-only environment.

---

## 🧩 Objectives

- To create a secure and authenticated platform for intra-campus transactions.
- To simplify listing and discovery of second-hand goods.
- To build an intuitive and responsive interface for all device types.
- To integrate a scalable backend using Node.js and REST APIs.
- To implement basic CRUD operations with real-time updates.

## 🏗️ System Architecture (Textual UML Overview)

            ┌──────────────────────────┐
            │        Frontend          │
            │  React Components (UI)   │
            └────────────┬─────────────┘
                         │ REST API Calls
                         ▼
            ┌──────────────────────────┐
            │        Backend API       │
            │  Node.js + Express.js    │
            └────────────┬─────────────┘
                         │ Mongoose ODM
                         ▼
            ┌──────────────────────────┐
            │        MongoDB           │
            │   Listings / Users / Chat│
            └──────────────────────────┘

This architecture follows an MVC-inspired separation:

- **Frontend**: handles presentation and user interaction.
- **Backend**: manages data routing, authentication, and validation.
- **Database**: persists structured user and listing data.
